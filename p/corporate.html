	      <p>The health and happiness of employees has been profoundly affected over the last three
decades primarily by changes in technology and therefore changes to the business and
working environment.</p>
	      <p>Longer working hours, more stress, less time for breaks and the general increased
expectations that employers have of their employees, brings with it a very real ability for
an individual's work to profoundly affect their health, and in turn, for their health to
profoundly affect their work.</p>
	      <p>It is now well understood that that a fit, healthy, happy workforce can help to improve the
health and well being of a business, ultimately impacting on its and its employees future
development and success.</p>
	      <p>Well-targeted stress management and nutritional education in the workplace are key
components for a healthy workforce and have been proven to:</p>
          <li style="margin-top:25px;">Reduced absenteeism</li>
          <li>Lower company health insurance premiums</li>
          <li>Improved morale</li>
          <li>Improve motivation</li>
          <li style='margin-bottom:25px;'>Improve company loyalty</li>
          <p>It takes a forward looking organisation to extend their corporate concerns to taking active,
meaningful and measurable steps to promote the health and happiness of their workforce
- and this is especially so when it comes to encouraging improvement their nutritional
wellbeing.</p>
          <p>While everyone's health is ultimately; 'their own business', there are many opportunities to
help educate and influence behaviour to promote a more nutritious way of eating for the
individual within the day-to- day working environment and of course at home.</p>
          <p>This can be achieved both through direct education of employees through workshops.
Please feel free to contact me to discuss a tailor made package for your company.</p>
