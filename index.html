      <h1>Welcome To Balance Your Body</h1>
      <p style='margin-bottom:30px;'>Are you struggling with an undiagnosed or an on going health concern including
IBS, hormonal imbalances, fatigue, weight issues, stress, insomnia, skin
conditions or joint pain?</p>
      <div class="hide">
        <p style='margin-bottom:30px;'>Are blood tests results coming back clear or inconclusive and you are being told there is nothing wrong, when clearly there is?</p>
        <p style='margin-bottom:30px;'>If modern day medicines have left you feeling depleted and still unwell – there’s a good reason. It’s because we are all unique and there is no one pill, diet, or exercise program that works for everyone.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">By personalizing your nutrition we will be able to pinpoint imbalances,
understand why they are occurring, identify what you require to thrive from
your food nutritionally, learn how to incorporate beneficial exercise and what
to do each day to get back to health and happiness.</p>
        <p>Our natural state is one of vibrant health, but many of the choices we make
(often unknowingly) push us out of this homeostasis. When you learn how to
live in accordance with your true nature, you automatically awaken your
body’s incredible ability to heal.</p>

          <h2>Lisa</h2>
          <p>"I first saw Lea about three years ago, and she has used kinesiology to transform my health. For several years I had been feeling nauseous, was regularly shaky and tense, and physically stiff and tired. Lea identified dietary intolerances in one session, helped me improve my diet, and recommended supplements which have drastically improved my reaction to stress, reduced joint pain and made me more resistant to illness."</p>
          <p id="testhide">"I now feel healthy and in a much better position to cope with life's challenges. Lea is a great listener, generous with her time and always on hand when I need help. I still see her every three months or so to keep on an even keel and to nip problems in the bud. If anyone would like a personal recommendation, please feel free to ask Lea for my contact details."</p>

          <img src="user.png" alt="" width="75px" height="auto">
          <p>"I was recommended to Lea in December. After two weeks of following her advice my joint pain eased and the craving to eat gone. After a month I had dropped a dress size, had more energy and my stress levels lower- I will continue to follow her advice and eating plan, which is easy to follow. I now think 'Green' plate - Thank you Lea !"</p>

          <img src="user.png" alt="" width="75px" height="auto">
          <p>"Lea is the most intuitive nutritional therapist I have ever come across. Having tried for many years to overcome a particular problem, and used many alternative therapists, it was only Lea who was able to find something that truly changes my life on a daily basis. Lots of people can train in the field but very few have that sixth sense to go beyond the obvious. Highly recommended."</p>

		<p>"Words cannot express how thankful I am to Lea for the positive changes in my life that her treatment has caused. My energy levels have gone through the roof and my general feeling of wellbeing is nothing short of amazing, so much so that nearly everybody who knows me has noticed the difference. I am so grateful to her for educating me as to how my body works and consequently how my life has turned around since implementing the changes she recommended."</p>
