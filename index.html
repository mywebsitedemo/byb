      <h1>Food Sensitivity</h1>
      <p>During your consultation you will be advised on the use of diet and food supplements to aid detoxification, restore balance, and address potential nutritional deficiencies you may have and are potentially affecting your health.</p>
      <div class="hide">
        <p>For a personalised nutritional approach to restore optimal health, Systematic Kinesiology ‘muscle testing’ will be used to identify current imbalances, food sensitivities, and will allow for a personalised healthy eating plan and supplementation program to be created for you.</p>
        <p>You are encourage to bring along small amounts of food in the form that it is eaten, ie eggs are boiled and not raw and vegetables steamed if this is how you cook them.</p>
        <p>The most common foods that are tested include Dairy Products – Milk, Cheese, Cream and Yoghurt (Cow’s and Goat’s). Wheat, Gluten, Yeast, Meat, Fish, Eggs, Nuts and Seeds, Fruits and Vegetables, Tea, Coffee and Sugar.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that up to 45% of people experience adverse health symptoms due to food intolerances which may include reflux, bloating, hay fever, sinus issues, constipation, IBS, joint pain, candida, migraines, skin problems – acne, eczema, psoriasis fatigue and auto immune conditions.</p>
        <p>Each of us has a unique biochemistry, and any food, even if considered healthy, can create health problems for one individual and but be perfectly fine for another. Individuals who are intolerant of high Histamine foods are a good example.</p>
        <p>Kinesiology ‘muscle testing’ is an effective tool for determining food sensitivities. Results are immediate and testing is very straightforward, takes place with the individual fully clothed and is suitable for both adults and children.</p>
        <p>Appointments are 30 minutes for children (unless you request and are chargable for longer) and 60 Minutes for adults. </p>
        <p>The cost of the Food Sensitivity session includes a personalised health eating and supplementation plan that will be emailed to you after the appointment.</p>

          <h2>Lisa - December 2014</h2>
          <p>"I first saw Lea about three years ago, and she has used kinesiology to transform my health. For several years I had been feeling nauseous, was regularly shaky and tense, and physically stiff and tired. Lea identified dietary intolerances in one session, helped me improve my diet, and recommended supplements which have drastically improved my reaction to stress, reduced joint pain and made me more resistant to illness."</p>
          <p id="testhide">"I now feel healthy and in a much better position to cope with life's challenges. Lea is a great listener, generous with her time and always on hand when I need help. I still see her every three months or so to keep on an even keel and to nip problems in the bud. If anyone would like a personal recommendation, please feel free to ask Lea for my contact details."</p>

          <img src="user.png" alt="" width="75px" height="auto">
          <p>"I was recommended to Lea in December. After two weeks of following her advice my joint pain eased and the craving to eat gone. After a month I had dropped a dress size, had more energy and my stress levels lower- I will continue to follow her advice and eating plan, which is easy to follow. I now think 'Green' plate - Thank you Lea !"</p>

          <img src="user.png" alt="" width="75px" height="auto">
          <p>"Lea is the most intuitive nutritional therapist I have ever come across. Having tried for many years to overcome a particular problem, and used many alternative therapists, it was only Lea who was able to find something that truly changes my life on a daily basis. Lots of people can train in the field but very few have that sixth sense to go beyond the obvious. Highly recommended."</p>

		<h2>Susan - October 2016</h2>
		<img src="user.png" alt="" width="75px" height="auto">
		<p>"Words cannot express how thankful I am to Lea for the positive changes in my life that her treatment has caused. My energy levels have gone through the roof and my general feeling of wellbeing is nothing short of amazing, so much so that nearly everybody who knows me has noticed the difference. I am so grateful to her for educating me as to how my body works and consequently how my life has turned around since implementing the changes she recommended."</p>
